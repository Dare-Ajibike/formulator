# formulator

A Flutter-based development analyzer and cost estimator for organizational benchmarking.


## Description
Formulator is a development and cost estimation application developed as a Mechanical Engineering Master's project developed for a student of Prof. P. K. Oke, the Dean of the School of Metallurgical and Manufacturing Engineering (SIMME) in the Federal University of Technology, Akure.

## Purpose

The main purpose of the application is:
1. To analyse the estimated level of development of an organisation as compared to a benchmark and express this in numerical values.
2. To analyse the cost required to bring the level of development to a particular level.
3. To properly distribute the cost in such a manner as to maximize impact of the resources on the level of development.

To achieve this purposes, advanced academic algorithms are implemented and the results are displayed in a perfectly reactive and sleek modern User interface.
